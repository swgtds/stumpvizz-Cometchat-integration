I have also deployed the project

## What is this?

This project is part of the **CometChat Internship Assignment**. The goal is to integrate the CometChat UI Kit into a basic application and showcase how it works in a functional use case.

I have used a **cricket-themed live streaming concept** where fans can:
- Login with a UID and **Live Chat** with other viewers
- Choose a live cricket match and Live Chat with viewers
- Join a dedicated group chat for that match and also there is a **global** chat.
